# Interviewcake solutions

I am currently challenging myself to learn data structures, algorithms, and the core principles of computer science for Javascript.
One resource I am making use of is the site Interviewcake, which provides challenges and learning material on these topics.
This is the collection of my learning and answers.  Some have multiple iterations on them as I learn better approaches. All solutions come with tests.

To run:

```javascript
npm install
npm test
```
